PyInvEdit redistributes the following components:

  * The NBT Processing libraries from pymclevel
    https://github.com/codewarrior0/pymclevel
    https://github.com/mcedit/pymclevel
    http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26098-pymclevel-minecraft-levels-for-python/
    Many thanks to codewarrior0 for providing that excellent library, and
    to the various folks keeping the project alive after codewarrior0's
    departure.  It's available under a BSDish license, see LICENSE-pymclevel.txt
    for its full text.

  * Various files from Minecraft's builtin texturepack
    http://www.minecraft.net/
    Specifically: terrain.png and gui/items.png
    Technically this redistribution is in violation of Mojang's stated 
    "Do not distribute anything we've made" rule, but I'm pretty sure that
    this kind of usage would be acceptible regardless, especially given that
    the bundled texturepack is only used in extreme corner cases where the
    user's installed minecraft.jar can't be found on the drive.  Plus, many
    other prominent community tools have been bundling terrain.png for some
    time now (INVedit, MCEdit, etc).  Ah, the "everyone else was doing it"
    argument!  Anyway, I will of course readily cease using the official
    texturepack in here if asked.

  * A couple of icons from InvEdit
    https://github.com/copyboy/INVedit
    http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/14190-12-invedit-minecraft-inventory-editor/
    The forum link says that it's "public domain."
